Hi. My name is James Curley and I'm an Associate Professor in the Psychology Department at the University of Texas at Austin.  I'm British. I like scrabble and cricket.

In this blog I will make short posts related to data or code that I find interesting - or useful for my students. This isn't a place where I'll likely post anything related to my research.  I'd be interested in feedback.

My GitHub page [is here](https://github.com/jalapic)
